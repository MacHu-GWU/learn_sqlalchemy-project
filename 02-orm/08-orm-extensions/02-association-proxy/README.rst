associationproxy is used to create a read/write view of a target attribute across a relationship. It essentially conceals the usage of a “middle” attribute between two endpoints, and can be used to cherry-pick fields from a collection of related objects or to reduce the verbosity of using the association object pattern. Applied creatively, the association proxy allows the construction of sophisticated collections and dictionary views of virtually any geometry, persisted to the database using standard, transparently configured relational patterns.
